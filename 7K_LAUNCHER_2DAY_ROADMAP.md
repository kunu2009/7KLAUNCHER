# 7K Launcher: 2-Day Implementation Roadmap

This research-based roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing the most critical features of the 7K Launcher in a 2-day timeframe. It prioritizes features based on competitive analysis, user impact, and implementation complexity.

## Overview: Market-Driven Implementation Strategy

Based on comprehensive competitive analysis of top Android launchers (Nova, Niagara, Smart Launcher, Microsoft Launcher), this roadmap focuses on:

1. **Closing Critical Competitive Gaps**: Implementing must-have features (icon packs, gestures, backup/restore) that users expect from modern launchers
2. **Enhancing Unique Value Propositions**: Refining the distinctive glass UI aesthetic and sidebar functionality that differentiate 7K Launcher
3. **Establishing Core Platform**: Building the foundation for the 7K ecosystem integration

The implementation is divided into 10 focused blocks across 2 days:
- **Day 1**: Core functionality, UI refinement, and critical features
- **Day 2**: Advanced features, ecosystem integration, and polish

Each task includes specific implementation details, file references, estimated time requirements, and technical implementation guidance based on market research.

#### Tasks:
1. **Project audit & dependency check**
   - Verify all dependencies in `app/build.gradle`
   - Ensure AndroidX libraries are up-to-date (Material Components, ConstraintLayout, Lifecycle)
   - Add any missing libraries for implementation (Glide/Coil for image loading, Gson/Moshi for JSON serialization)
   - Review Gradle configuration for optimization opportunities

2. **Performance baseline**
   - Run baseline performance tests using `com.sevenk.launcher.util.Perf`
   - Document current frame rates and memory usage during home screen scrolling, app drawer opening/closing
   - Profile UI rendering to identify performance bottlenecks in animations and glass effects
   - Create performance metrics dashboard for measuring improvements

3. **Codebase organization**
   - Ensure clean package structure aligned with feature modules
   - Group related components (e.g., launcher core, widgets, sidebar, themes, settings)
   - Implement clear separation between UI, data, and business logic
   - Audit and clean unused resources and code

#### Market Research Insights:
- Top launchers (Nova, Action) maintain high performance even with advanced features
- Most modern launchers use Material Components library for consistent UI elements
- Performance is a key differentiator, especially on mid-range devices

#### Resources:
- Existing code in `app/src/main/java/com/sevenk/launcher/`
- Android Studio Profiler for performance metrics
- [Android Performance Patterns](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance)

### Block 2: Home Screen & App Drawer Refinement (3 hours)
- **Goal**: Ensure the core launcher functionality (home screen & app drawer) works flawlessly

#### Tasks:
1. **Home screen layout polishing**
   - Review and refine `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_launcher.xml` with proper spacing for the glass UI aesthetic
   - Implement Inter/Montserrat typography as specified in the brand guidelines
   - Ensure responsive layout across different screen sizes and orientations
   - Add proper elevation and shadow for depth perception in the glass UI

2. **App drawer implementation**

#### Tasks:
1. **Icon pack manager implementation**
   - Create/enhance `com.sevenk.launcher.iconpack.IconPackHelper` to follow industry standards
   - Implement methods to scan for installed icon packs using `PackageManager` queries for known providers
   - Create a data structure to store icon pack metadata with efficient caching
   - Add support for popular formats (Nova, ADW, Apex, LauncherPro, Go, Holo)

2. **Icon resolution system**
   - Implement logic to resolve app package to custom icon using drawable name conventions
   - Create fallback mechanism for missing icons with auto-generation based on first letter
   - Implement multi-level LRU caching for better performance (memory and disk cache)

3. **Icon pack selection UI**
   - Add icon pack selection to settings with visual previews
   - Create carousel/grid preview of icon packs with sample icons
   - Implement apply/revert functionality with progress indicator
   - Add individual icon customization option (long-press an icon to customize)

#### Market Research Insights:
- Nova Launcher supports 6+ icon pack formats with a unified resolution system
- Smart Launcher's Icon Pack Studio allows creating custom icon packs and styles
- Most users expect both global icon pack application and per-icon customization
- Icon resolution performance is critical for smooth scrolling in app drawers

#### Technical Considerations:

2. **Apply glass effect consistently**
   - Ensure dock, sidebar, and app drawer use consistent glass effect with shared styles
   - Implement glass cards for app icons with subtle elevation and inner shadows
   - Add subtle animations for glass elements (fade-in/out with spring physics)
   - Apply consistent corner radii across all glass elements (16dp standard radius)

3. **Performance optimization for glass effects**
   - Implement conditional rendering based on device capability (API level detection)
   - Create fallbacks for older Android versions using gradient+transparency instead of true blur
   - Optimize blur calculations for battery efficiency by reducing render resolution on low-end devices
   - Implement background thread rendering for blur effects to avoid UI thread blocking

#### Market Research Insights:
- iOS's frosted glass effect has strong user satisfaction but rarely implemented well on Android
- Blur effects when implemented properly create a significant perceived quality difference
- Modern implementations use `RenderEffect` API on Android 12+ with hardware acceleration
- Successful blur implementations adjust intensity based on device capability

#### Technical Considerations:
- Use `RenderEffect.createBlurEffect()` for Android 12+ (API 31+)
- Implement `renderscript` or custom shader fallbacks for older versions
- Consider using `DynamicColors` API to complement glass theming
- Pre-render static glass elements where possible to reduce runtime overhead
